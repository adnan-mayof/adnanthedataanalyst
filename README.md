### Hi there 👋, 
And welcome to my page! I'm Adnan and I am passionate about data analysis, storytelling, and visualization. Data visualization is a particular love of mine, and I create vizzes either in Tableau (see my Tableau Public page) or in Python, or I mix these two tools. For analysis, I mainly choose economic data, since I worked for many years as an economic and financial journalist, or historical data, simply out of love for the topic.
