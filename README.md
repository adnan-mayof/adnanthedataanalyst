<h1>Hi there 👋, </h1>


And welcome to my page! I'm Adnan, and I have a deep passion for data analysis, storytelling, and visualization. I particularly adore data visualization, crafting visualizations using Tableau  [visit my Tableau Public page](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/adnan.mayof/vizzes), R, or Python, and sometimes combining these tools. With a background spanning roles such as Post-doctoral Research Scholar, Health Promotion Liaison, Writing Teaching Assistant, and Professional Development Initiative Liaison, my repository is filled with datasets in health, education, professional development, and historical data—mirroring my profound interest in these subjects. I am excited to share my insights and analyses with you!
